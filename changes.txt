* Misinterpreted comment about missing values in data documentation
* Accidentally put both the original variable ethicity and the derived variable "majority" in the analysis; removed these
* Tried using ESTIMATOR = BAYES for main models because integration did not converge
* Removed categorical items, because no DIC is available for cat outcomes http://www.statmodel.com/discussion/messages/9/6256.html?1600907976
* DIC is not available for latent variable interactions, thus it is not possible to determine best fitting model according to preregistration
* Decided to conduct path analysis with mean score scales of the observed variables to determine best fitting model, then revert back to Bayes for estimation of the final model
* Final model does not converge with Bayes; decided to use path analysis with mean scores for all analyses
